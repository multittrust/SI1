        <p>This special issue, inspired by the International Workshops on Multidisciplinary Perspectives on Human-AI
          Team Trust (<a href="https://multittrust.github.io/">MultiTTrust</a>), delves into the dynamics of trust
          within human-AI teams. It seeks to explore complex interactions and trust-building mechanisms in these
          collaborations, addressing the rapidly evolving field of AI in societal and technological contexts.</p>
          <p>We welcome submissions from a diverse range of fields, including but not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</li>
            <li>Cognitive Science and Psychology</li>
            <li>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</li>
            <li>Robotics and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)</li>
            <li>Computer Science and Engineering</li>

        <p><strong>Submission Guidelines</strong></p>
        <p>Submissions should adhere to a minimum length of 8 pages and a maximum of 20 pages (excluding references),
          approximately corresponding to 3,600 to 8,000 words, to ensure comprehensive coverage and maintain
          conciseness. Moreover, submissions based on previous workshop papers must include significant expansion in
          terms of content, depth, and scope, with new material to be considered for publication. For aspects not
          explicitly outlined in our call, we will adhere to the <a
            href="https://benjamins.com/catalog/is/guidelines">submission guidelines</a> of 'Interaction Studies',
          encompassing standard protocols for formatting, manuscript structuring, and the overall submission process.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Review Process</strong></p>
        <p>The review process will begin with an initial screening by the guest editors to ensure each submission aligns
          with the special issue's scope and thematic focus. Once deemed suitable, manuscripts will undergo a
          peer-review process, involving independent reviews by experts in the field. These reviews will evaluate the
          manuscript for its academic rigor, contribution to the field, and adherence to the special issue's themes.
          Based on these reviews, the outcomes for each manuscript may include: acceptance, acceptance with minor
          revisions, revise and resubmit pending major revisions, or outright rejection. The final decision on
          manuscript acceptance will be based on the reviewers' recommendations and the guest editors' judgment,
          ensuring a fair and comprehensive assessment of each submission.</p>
